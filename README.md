# robot_follower

Goal: Project to learn real time systems and machine vision technologies. Creating a robot that can follow you around using a webcam, 3D printed chassis and wheels, motor, and Raspberry Pi 4. 

Webcam will be used for object detection (human). 3d Printing will be used to design chassis that webcam and wheels will be mounted to. Motor(s) - one will be used for rotating camera, and the other will be for drivetrain. Raspberry Pi 4 serves as central data processing from webcam input and converting to motor controls output. 

Phases:

Phase 1: Set up RPi and webcam to be able to detect a person in the camera image.
Phase 2: Add motor to rotate camera to follow person as they walk. Will need to create some sort of mounting to couple motor and webcam.
Phase 3: Assemble drive train and connect to rpi
Phase 4: Design and implement software for following human (following distance, speed, etc)
Phase 5: Put it all together
